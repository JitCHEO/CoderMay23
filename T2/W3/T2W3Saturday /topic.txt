    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(15), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False)


    nullable=False means not null, means it cant be leave empty
